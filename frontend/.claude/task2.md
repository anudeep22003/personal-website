There is a professional history route that we setup in ProfessionalHistory.tsx. It is hooked up into the router and can be seen in the header links. 

For this page, I want to visualize a timeline, a compact timeline of my professional history. 

Dates are not as important as time ranges. Each section will have a start time and end time, ideally the end of one should be the srart of the next. 

In terms of a UI, we are still holding to our black and white minimalist style. But let your inspiration run, and build me something simple that still evokes the concept and feeling of a timeline, in the physics sense of that word. 

My resume content is at public/resume.md. Convert the points for each experience into a narrative. Brief points are good for resume, but when somebody is reading you want to make what you have written readable, brief and not overstaying the welcome of the attention it gets. 

Each experience, should be like an island in time, should connect to the next by a thread. The thread floppy, not awlasy straight but what ti does unfailingly, is to hold together time that you have lived through.

I want recruiters and VC to be able to get a broadstroke and then also read deeper if intrigued.

Localize your changes to the ProfessionalHistory page. Incorporate a table of component (it's prebuilt, see how to use it in ai-docs/available-to-use.md)
