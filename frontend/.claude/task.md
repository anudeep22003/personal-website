Here we are focusing all our efforts on About.tsx only. We are going to focus at it both from a design, and content standpoint. We like minimal design. Right now we are using grayscale (mostly black and white) with green as an accent color to be used sparingly. Links use the green sccent. So all highlights either as badges, gradients should play with the limited set of colors black, white, green and their shades. 

The target who we are looking to entice are venture capitalists who look me up to decide whether to invest in me or even take a meeting. Another is a recruiter, I am open to th emost interesting opportunities. 

The vibe I was originally going for was no caps, which i do like and I am following that on other pages and even the header, I acknowledge that for long text, the no caps makes reading hard. Bring back sentence case in the main write up. Use a subtle green to highlight. I dont like quote callouts, it isnt me. Pretentious and douchey that you are quoting yourself. But add color of different grades of green to show degrees of importance. It can be subtle. The discerning eye will pick it up. This will help add color to what otherwise may look like a wall of text. 

Also incorporate into the end, these two sections

Areas of interest:
So in terms of what I am interested in, right around here I am thinking about basic models and building self improving agents and novel cognitive architectures And I am particularly interested in memory as a symbolic representation of consciousness. Here levels of association lead to different sparking intensities. So building complex memory architectures because in memory is where our self lives.  Now the things that I am really interested in, are is building reasoning models, building self-improving agents, building memory architectures that are aligned with the neuroscience of how it is in our brain. How degree of life as a being kind of begins. If we did not have a strong memory of the past, we would not have a strong sense of identity. Identity is built on our memory. So, building very novel architectures, novel cognitive architectures to incorporate the neuroscience of the brain is something I am deeply passionate about. 

Where I am right now:
In what I'm doing, like how to end it is that I recently exited a startup where we will make AI-Interviewer tools. I recently exited that and am now looking around for my next opportunity. I am noodling on some things that I want to build, building on some of those things And also open to opportunities where I get to bring both my product and engineering capabilities, the depth in both of those to solve the hard problems, hard not just technically but from a product and consumer standpoint as well. 

Put those last two points in their own section. One for what interests, and one for where I am right now. Add a nice looking table of content to the side that allows quick scrolling. 
Use the space well. Use libraries sparingly, but do if it makes sense.
