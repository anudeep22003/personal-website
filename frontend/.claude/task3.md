Now you have two tasks:

1. Keep the tldrs mostly the same, add to the one that we built all the components storage, auth, payment, credit management, user management and admin settings. 
2. Then, redo the write up for each experience in the ProfessionalHistory.tsx, it is too long. Make it tighter, come from a place of authenticity and knowing that the universe conspires in your favor. No pick me behavior, no using a adjective lazily to tell the user what to feel, than letting them feel. Some of them should be half, and some maybe only 20%
