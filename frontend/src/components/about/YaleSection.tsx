        Spent 9 months forcing my brain to connect every new idea
        to something I already knew, decomposing thoughts until I
        hit first principles. Uncomfortable as hell, but it
        worked. Eventually all knowledge felt
        interconnectedâ€”biology, physics, AI, spirituality,
        everything resonating across the same trunk of truth.

        I also interned at Apple, and started a company one after
        the other. Worked on high-profile projects such as App
        Store Redesign and Single Sign-On, but still, the fun I
        had at the startup had my heart. Came back, knew that I
        wanted to work as a PM at an early-stage startup. It was
        not an easy decision.
