        Grew up moving around a lot, switching curriculums and
        schools. Read a lot, participated in quizzes. Once, Dad
        bought me a microscope from a work trip to Germany and I
        brought it to school and set up samples, showing all my
        friends what blood, skin, and hair look like at the
        microscopic level. I was confident but undirected. In
        engineering, I studied computer science but yearned to be
        a mechanical engineer. I reluctantly accepted CS. Tried
        running away from tech by doing consulting, but slowly and
        surely I found my own way back to tech.

        Fell in love with product management from India, dreamed
        of San Francisco. Took me two years and countless
        rejections to get into Yaleâ€”the only school that gave me a
        shot.
