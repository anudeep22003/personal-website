User: 
OK lets think about how we could implement authorization and authentication in agents. One naive way is to create a private database for the agent that holds the tokens, refresh keys and all that jazz. It will also hold an OIDC JWT for authentication. This would work for long range agents, i.e. agents that once spawned stay alive unless explicitly killed. Then all the keys and tokens will be useful. This is a naive approach, what are better ways we could do this. There arent really best practices given how new agents are, but what are some best practices that people have come up with implementing auth and authorization in traditional systems. 

Agents are still unclear but they can reason, use tools, figure out a plan or what the next step is and do it in order to accomplish an overarching goal.

Below is a menu of design patterns and guard-rails that security teams already apply to micro-services and machine-to-machine (M2M) workloads, mapped to the quirks of long-running or autonomous AI agents.  You can mix-and-match, but each pattern solves a specific failure mode in the “naïve private-DB-with-tokens” approach you described.

⸻

1 · Identity & credential issuance

What to do	Why it helps agents	Tech notes
Managed or “baked-in” identities (AWS IAM roles, Azure Managed Identities, Kubernetes ServiceAccounts)	The runtime gets its own X-509 or STS token on start-up, so nothing long-lived needs to be stored with the agent	Ephemeral compute that carries an identity is becoming the norm for AI agent sandboxes  ￼
OAuth 2 Client-Credentials / Service Account flow	Each agent exchanges its client ID + secret for a short-lived access-token scoped to exactly one downstream API	Rotate the client secret on build or redeploy; set token TTL to minutes, not hours
Sender-constrained tokens (DPoP, mTLS)	Stops token replay – a stolen token only works from the instance that owns the private key	Called out as a MUST in the 2025 OAuth 2 Security BCP (RFC 9700)  ￼
Token vault / secret manager	Centralizes storage, rotation and revocation; lets SecOps see every non-human identity (NHI) that the org owns	Okta’s new Auth for GenAI exposes a vault plus rotation APIs specifically for agents  ￼


⸻

2 · Authorization (who can the agent act as, and on what?)
	1.	External Policy Decision Point (PDP) – run OPA, Cedar, or Permit.io as a side-car or separate micro-service.  The agent just calls is_allowed(subject, action, resource) and never hard-codes rules  ￼.
	2.	Policy-as-Code & GitOps – ship Rego / Cedar files through CI/CD so every change is versioned and reviews run in the same pipeline as code.
	3.	Context-aware decisions (ABAC / ReBAC) – agents often need to escalate from “read” to “write” mid-task; drive that via policy that checks real-time context (who started the agent, data classification, risk score, etc.).
	4.	Human-in-the-loop approvals – for destructive or costly actions emit a callback that must be approved by a user or workflow engine (Okta’s asynchronous authorization tier does this)  ￼.

⸻

3 · Secret-handling & token lifecycle

Practice	Why it matters	Reference
Short-lived access tokens	Shrinks the blast-radius; combine with automatic refresh	WorkOS & Auth0 both recommend minutes-long TTLs  ￼ ￼
Refresh-token rotation	Every refresh invalidates the previous token; theft is useless	RFC 9700 makes this a SHOULD for public clients  ￼
No secrets in code or DB snapshots	Prevents accidental leak via logs or analytics	Auth0 token-handling guidance  ￼
Audit & anomaly detection	Agents run 24 × 7, so real-time anomaly alerts (rate spikes, unusual scopes) are critical	WorkOS outlines monitoring unusual credential usage  ￼


⸻

4 · Zero-trust runtime hardening
	•	mTLS everywhere – authenticate both client and server; gives you channel-binding for sender-constrained tokens.
	•	Identity-aware proxy (IAP) – put a proxy in front of every internal service; agents authenticate once to the proxy and never see the backend credential set  ￼.
	•	Ephemeral sandboxes – spin up a fresh VM / container for each long-lived agent checkpoint; hydrate state from a data store, pull temp creds from vault, then discard.
	•	Kill-switch & bulk revocation – store an agent-ID → token mapping in the vault so you can instantly revoke every token the agent has ever used.

⸻

5 · End-to-end blueprint (tying it together)
	1.	Spawn agent
	•	The orchestrator assigns a unique service-account / managed identity.
	•	Sidecar pulls the latest Rego/Cedar policy bundle.
	2.	Acquire credentials
	•	At runtime the agent calls the organization’s STS or OAuth 2 token endpoint using its service-account key.
	•	Receives a 5-minute, sender-constrained access-token plus a rotating refresh-token stored only in memory.
	3.	Act & decide
	•	Every privileged call flows through a local PDP (check(subject, action, resource)).
	•	If PDP says “needs approval”, the call is queued until a human approves via an out-of-band channel.
	4.	Observe & adapt
	•	All authN/authZ events stream to SIEM; anomaly rules alert on scope creep or rate spikes.
	•	Token vault rotates the service-account key every N hours and forces live agents to re-authenticate.

⸻

Key take-aways
	•	Don’t persist secrets with the agent. Let infrastructure inject or mint them JIT.
	•	Externalize decisions. A standalone policy engine + policy-as-code keeps rules auditable and fast to change.
	•	Limit each credential. Short TTL, least-privilege scopes, sender-binding, and quick revocation together reduce lateral movement risk.
	•	Design for oversight. Human-in-the-loop escapes and dense audit logs are essential because agents run faster—and sometimes weirder—than humans can predict.

Apply these patterns incrementally: start by moving tokens into a vault and stripping scopes, then introduce a PDP, and finally layer on sender-constrained tokens or mTLS when the operational overhead is tolerable.

User:
So in this scenario, an agent essentially has its own compute engine? As in it is a server right?

Also , explain all the tools and terminologies you introduced. Such as Rego, Cedar, STS, PDP, SIEM, Permit.io, X509. DPoP, mTLS. Assume I have no prior knowledge, but am a senior engineer

AI:
1  ·  Does an agent “have its own server”?

Think of an agent as software that needs a runtime, not a permanent box.  In practice you have three common deployment styles:

Style	What the compute looks like	Typical lifetime	How creds are injected
Ephemeral container / function (e.g., AWS Lambda, Cloud Run job)	Spins up on-demand, goes to zero	Seconds → minutes	Short-lived STS token minted at start-up
Long-running side-car or pod	Stays alive next to an app or micro-service	Hours → days	Service-account identity exposed via the platform (K8s SA token, IAM role)  ￼
Dedicated VM / bare-metal (rare for agents)	Traditional server, you manage the OS	Weeks → months	You must rotate keys yourself or attach an identity-aware proxy

So yes, an agent uses compute, but the industry norm is to give it ephemeral, identity-bearing infrastructure rather than a hand-built server that stores long-lived secrets.

2  ·  Glossary of terms & tools

Term	What it is	Why it matters to agents
Rego	A declarative policy language used by Open Policy Agent (OPA). You write rules like allow { input.method == "GET" }. Engine evaluates requests against data/config you supply.  ￼	Lets you embed fine-grained “allow/deny” logic in the agent runtime without hard-coding if/else statements.
Cedar	AWS-backed, open-source policy language and evaluator optimized for speed and static analysis. Supports RBAC, ABAC, and JSON-like policies.  ￼	Good choice when you need millisecond authorization checks at hyperscale; integrates well with AWS services.
STS (Security Token Service)	A service (spec in WS-Trust, implemented by AWS STS, Azure AD, Okta, etc.) that mints temporary credentials—access key, secret, session token—after authenticating a caller.  ￼	Agents call STS to swap a long-term identity (role, service account) for short-lived tokens with scoped permissions.
PDP (Policy Decision Point)	The component that evaluates an access request against policies and returns “permit” or “deny.” Often OPA, Cedar-authorizer, or a cloud-native equivalent.  ￼	Keeps authZ logic out of the agent’s code; you just call is_allowed() and act on the answer.
SIEM (Security Information & Event Management)	A platform that ingests logs, detects anomalies, and raises alerts (e.g., Splunk, IBM QRadar, Azure Sentinel).  ￼	Stream every authN/authZ event so you can spot compromised tokens or runaway agents in real time.
Permit.io	“Authorization-as-a-Service”: hosted policy engine + UI + audit trail; supports Rego and Cedar under the hood.  ￼	Off-loads policy storage, editing, and approval workflows—handy if your agent farm is small and you don’t want to run OPA yourself.
X.509 certificate	An ITU-T standard that binds a public key to an identity; packaged in PEM/DER files and signed by a CA. Widely used in TLS/SSL.  ￼	Forms the basis for mTLS and sender-constrained tokens—an agent proves “I own this private key.”
DPoP (Demonstration of Proof-of-Possession)	OAuth 2.0 extension (RFC 9449) that cryptographically ties an access token to a client-held key via a JWS header on each request.  ￼	Stops token replay: even if the bearer token leaks, an attacker can’t use it without the private key.
mTLS (mutual TLS)	TLS handshake where both client and server present X.509 certs, authenticating each other.  ￼	Gives you channel-binding for DPoP or JWTs and protects east-west calls between agent micro-services.


⸻

How these pieces fit together in an agent workflow
	1.	Startup – The container launches with no secrets; it has a managed identity (service-account or IAM role).
	2.	Credential acquisition – Agent exchanges that identity for a short-lived access token via STS.
	3.	Policy check – Before each privileged action, the agent calls a local or remote PDP (running Rego or Cedar).
	4.	Secure transport – Requests to back-end APIs are signed using DPoP or ride over mTLS with X.509 certs.
	5.	Observability – All auth events stream into your SIEM, and policy changes flow through GitOps or Permit.io UI.

By decoupling credentials (STS), decisions (PDP), and enforcement (agent code), you get the least-privilege, highly observable security posture that modern autonomous agents need.

	2.	PDPClient.is_allowed externalizes authorization; swap the stub for a live OPA/Cedar endpoint.
	3.	DPoP.sign_proof binds every request to the agent’s ECDSA key, giving sender-constrained semantics.
	4.	requests.Session(cert=(…)) demonstrates mutual TLS—both sides present X.509 certificates.
	5.	Agent.call_api glues it all together in roughly 30 lines.

Use this skeleton as a launch pad: replace the stubbed secrets, plug in your real STS / PDP URLs, and you have an end-to-end working prototype of ephemeral creds + external policy + sender binding + mTLS.

User:
draw me a mermaid sequence diagram that shows the flow

AI:
Here’s a Mermaid sequence diagram that illustrates the full flow of the agent securely acquiring credentials, authorizing an action, and calling a downstream API using DPoP and mTLS:

sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    participant Agent
    participant STS as Security Token Service (STS)
    participant PDP as Policy Decision Point (OPA/Cedar)
    participant API as Downstream API (mTLS + DPoP)

    Note over Agent: Start action: POST to /api/v1/docs/42 as 'alice'

    Agent->>PDP: is_allowed("alice", "write", "doc:42:alice")
    alt Access granted
        PDP-->>Agent: true

        Agent->>STS: POST /token (client_id + secret)
        STS-->>Agent: Access Token (TTL=5min, scope="doc:42:alice")

        Agent->>Agent: Generate DPoP proof JWT (sign with private key)

        Agent->>API: POST /api/v1/docs/42\nHeaders: DPoP + Authorization
        Note right of API: Verifies mTLS cert, DPoP proof, token scope

        API-->>Agent: 200 OK

    else Access denied
        PDP-->>Agent: false
        Agent-->>Agent: Raise PermissionError
    end

What this shows:
	•	The Agent first checks with the PDP whether it’s allowed to act.
	•	If authorized, it fetches a short-lived token from STS using its identity.
	•	It signs a DPoP proof JWT with its private key.
	•	It sends a secure, sender-constrained request to the API over mutual TLS.
	•	The API validates the TLS handshake, the DPoP signature, and the access token before proceeding.

Let me know if you want a deployment diagram or a state diagram to go with this!

User:

Okay, help me deepen my understanding of what is happening here. Just going to read through it and ask questions out loud. Okay, so there is an STS client. So at from the mermaid diagram, I can understand that the agent makes the first request to the policy decision point. Okay, so what does the agent actually start with? Does the agent have any client keys or anything? Probably has a key, right, like a client ID or something like that. And then it, when it makes a request, it goes to the policy decision point, which is not the STS client, it is the PDP client. Yeah, okay, so the PDP client, what it does is it checks if the action that the agent is trying to do is allowed or not. So here, if I look at the function signature, there is a subject, there's an action, there's a resource, and there's a context. Okay, so here, it calls the OPSZR, returns true as permitted. It has an input doc, it has a subject, it like basically sets this up, and then if input doc subject equal to equal to, okay, you're mimicking this. Okay, so one thing that would be helpful for me is, can you create a dummy OPSZR rule, or whatever the policy is, like what is a very simple policy, just so that it helps with my understanding. Okay, so then let's say that it sends back a true, if it says false and it is not allowed, but if it sends back a true, it is allowed. So once it comes back, then it does a post to this STS with the client ID plus secret, because now it has been allowed. So it only knows that it has been allowed, it doesn't get anything back, like a key or anything of that sort. So now, the STS client is the one that is responsible for getting the actual access token. So here, it creates a payload, and then it encodes a JWT. And the key that it uses it to encode it is the client secret, which the server will have. So another thing is, each one of these things are separate server, like it's STS and PDP and all of these other separate servers, or they're all like within one. Okay, so once it gets back the token, then it generates a DPOP proof. Okay, so what is a DPOP proof? DPOP is a utility that binds the access token to this client's key pair. Okay, what does that mean? So here, return JWT.encode. So if I look at the agent, first it checks, right, then gets a token, then DPOP proof, go to self.dpop.signproof. Okay, so you sign it, you have a bunch of fields. What is HTM? What is HTU? What are all of these things? Okay, so then it signs the proof, and returns a JWT encoded thing, and then the self.key, eec.generatePrivateKey, what is this? You can assume that this is just some key that I can set, or is this a new key that gets set every time the DPOP class is instantialized? Okay, and then it takes those headers and includes them in the headers, which it then uses to make the request. And so on the backend side, I would be authenticating or authorizing on the DPOP token, not on the main token. So do I have to create a whole bunch of logic on the backend to take DPOPs, like a DPOP token versus a normal token? Help me analyze my commentary. There's some questions that I raised. Help me answer those questions, and then answer, and then synthesize everything, and then specifically help answer the backend portion of the question i raised.

---

AI: 
This is a great way to work through the flow—you’re interrogating each part of the system from first principles, which is exactly the right approach. Let’s break down and answer the questions you raised, then synthesize the flow, and finally dig into the backend responsibilities when validating DPoP + access tokens.

⸻

🔍 Q&A: Parsing your questions

⸻

1. What does the agent start with?

“Does the agent have any client keys or anything?”

Yes — the agent needs some initial identity or secret to prove who it is in order to request a token from the STS.

In our code:
	•	The agent holds a client_id and a client_secret.
	•	This is a simplification of a real-world credential, which might be:
	•	a client certificate (X.509),
	•	a service-account key (like Google or Kubernetes),
	•	or a signed attestation from the environment (like AWS IAM role with STS).

🟡 Key idea: The agent always needs some starting credential to bootstrap itself.

⸻

2. Is the PDP (policy decision point) separate from the STS?

“The PDP client is not the STS client, right?”

Correct.

PDP (Policy Decision Point)	STS (Security Token Service)
Decides if an action is allowed	Issues how to act: access tokens
Think: “Can Alice write to doc:42?”	Think: “Here is a token to act on doc:42”
Enforces authorization policies	Handles authentication and token issuance

🟡 Key idea: Authorization ≠ Authentication. The PDP decides should this happen, the STS says here’s a token to let it happen.

⸻

3. Can you show a dummy OPA policy?

Here’s a basic Rego policy that implements the same logic as your Python stub:

# policy.rego
package http.authz

default allow = false

allow {
  input.action == "read"
}

allow {
  input.subject == input.resource_owner
}

And sample input:

{
  "subject": "alice",
  "action": "write",
  "resource_owner": "alice"
}

✅ This would return true, because subject matches resource owner.

🟡 Key idea: Rego policies are just rules over structured input. You can express arbitrary logic.

⸻

4. What is a DPoP proof and how does it work?

“What does it mean that DPoP binds the token to the client’s key pair?”

💡 Think of DPoP as a “proof of possession” that says:

“This request is made by the same client who got the token.”

How?
	1.	The client creates an asymmetric key pair (ECDSA).
	2.	It signs a JWT with this private key, containing:
	•	htu = HTTP URI
	•	htm = HTTP method
	•	iat = issued at
	•	jti = unique token ID
	3.	The DPoP JWT is sent along with the access token, in the DPoP header.

So what does the backend do?
	•	It checks:
	•	Is the access token valid? (normal auth)
	•	Was the token issued for this key? (token includes the public key’s thumbprint)
	•	Does the DPoP proof’s public key match?
	•	Is the JWT signature valid?
	•	Do htu and htm match the current request?
	•	Is iat within tolerance? (to prevent replay)

This is what makes the access token sender-constrained. If someone steals the token but not the private key, they can’t use it.

🟡 Key idea: DPoP ties the token to the private key. The backend must validate both the token and the DPoP proof.

⸻

5. Does the agent generate a new key each time?

“Is this a new key that gets set every time the DPoP class is instantiated?”

In the demo: yes — every time you call DPoP(), a new key is generated.

In reality:
	•	You want to persist the key across requests for a given agent session.
	•	Rotate keys on a schedule or per agent instance.
	•	You don’t want one key forever, but you do want it long enough to be useful.

6. On the backend, do I need special logic for DPoP?

Yes. Here’s what the backend must do differently from normal bearer tokens:

Check	DPoP-specific?	Explanation
Validate access token	No	Same as OAuth2 bearer tokens
Extract public key thumbprint from token	Yes	Confirms key token was issued for
Validate DPoP header JWT	Yes	Using that public key
Confirm htu and htm match request	Yes	Prevents replay
Check iat is recent	Yes	Adds freshness / anti-replay
Enforce nonce-based replay protection (optional)	Yes	Advanced DPoP behavior

🟡 Key idea: DPoP adds about 5 extra steps to the backend’s auth logic, but gives you proof of sender identity.

⸻

✅ Synthesis: End-to-end flow

Let’s summarize what happens:
	1.	Agent Bootstraps Identity
	•	Has a client ID + secret (or managed identity / mTLS cert).
	•	Has a private key (for DPoP).
	2.	Authorization Check
	•	Calls PDP: “Can I POST to doc:42:alice as Alice?”
	•	PDP evaluates policy and responds yes/no.
	3.	Access Token Request
	•	Agent calls STS with client ID/secret.
	•	STS issues short-lived JWT with limited scope (doc:42:alice).
	4.	DPoP Proof Generation
	•	Agent signs a JWT with its private key: includes method, URL, timestamp.
	5.	Secure API Call
	•	Sends access token (Authorization: DPoP <token>)
	•	Sends DPoP proof (DPoP: <signed-JWT>)
	•	Sends request over mutual TLS (for additional security)
	6.	Backend Validation
	•	Verifies token and scope
	•	Verifies DPoP signature and public key binding
	•	Validates freshness, method, URI
	•	Serves or rejects request

🛠 Bonus Tip

To simplify DPoP validation on the backend, you can:
	•	Use an open-source middleware (e.g., Node.js @panva/dpop, Python’s authlib DPoP utilities).
	•	Offload to an API gateway like Kong or Envoy with token validation plugins.

Let me know if you want a backend validation code sample, or a diagram of how these checks stack in the backend call chain.

User:
yes show me a diagram of how these checks stack in the backend call chain. Use mermaid

AI:

Here’s a Mermaid flowchart diagram that shows how the backend stacks and executes token + DPoP + mTLS validation checks in sequence when handling a request from an agent:

flowchart TD
    A[Incoming HTTPS request] --> B[Mutual TLS handshake]
    B --> C{Is client cert valid?}
    C -- No --> Z1[Reject request: TLS failed]
    C -- Yes --> D[Extract Authorization and DPoP headers]

    D --> E[Validate Access Token (JWT)]
    E --> F{Is token valid?\n(Signature, expiry, scope)}
    F -- No --> Z2[Reject: Invalid access token]
    F -- Yes --> G[Extract public key thumbprint from token]

    G --> H[Parse DPoP proof JWT]
    H --> I{Is DPoP JWT valid?\n(Signature using public key)}
    I -- No --> Z3[Reject: Invalid DPoP proof]
    I -- Yes --> J{Does htm & htu match this request?}
    J -- No --> Z4[Reject: DPoP mismatch]
    J -- Yes --> K{Is 'iat' within freshness window?}
    K -- No --> Z5[Reject: DPoP too old or future-dated]

    K -- Yes --> L[✅ Pass auth checks – continue to handler]

🔍 Key Validation Layers (Top to Bottom)
	1.	mTLS check
	•	Verifies client presents a trusted certificate.
	•	Optional but highly recommended for internal services.
	2.	Access Token check
	•	Is the bearer JWT valid? Signature correct? Not expired? Contains needed scopes?
	3.	DPoP Proof check
	•	Is the proof signed using the correct key (bound to the token)?
	•	Does the method and URI match this request exactly?
	•	Is the proof “fresh” (not reused or delayed)?

⸻

✅ After all checks pass

You can safely route the request to your application logic, knowing:
	•	The token is valid.
	•	It was issued to a specific client with a unique key.
	•	The client actually sent the request (not a replay).
	•	The request came over a trusted channel.
