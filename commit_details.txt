+There is a professional history route that we setup in ProfessionalHistory.tsx. It is hooked up into the router and can be seen in the header links. 
+
+For this page, I want to visualize a timeline, a compact timeline of my professional history. 
+
+Dates are not as important as time ranges. Each section will have a start time and end time, ideally the end of one should be the srart of the next. 
+
+In terms of a UI, we are still holding to our black and white minimalist style. But let your inspiration run, and build me something simple that still evokes the concept and feeling of a timeline, in the physics sense of that word. 
+
+My resume content is at public/resume.md. Convert the points for each experience into a narrative. Brief points are good for resume, but when somebody is reading you want to make what you have written readable, brief and not overstaying the welcome of the attention it gets. 
+
+Each experience, should be like an island in time, should connect to the next by a thread. The thread floppy, not awlasy straight but what ti does unfailingly, is to hold together time that you have lived through.
+
+I want recruiters and VC to be able to get a broadstroke and then also read deeper if intrigued.
+
+Localize your changes to the ProfessionalHistory page. Incorporate a table of component (it's prebuilt, see how to use it in ai-docs/available-to-use.md)

+
+## TableOfContents
+
+**Location**: `src/components/TableOfContents.tsx`
+
+### Description
+A sticky table of contents component designed for long-form content pages. Provides navigation links for page sections with active section highlighting.
+
+### How it's built
+- React functional component with TypeScript
+- Uses Tailwind CSS for styling with neutral color scheme and green accent
+- Sticky positioned on large screens, hidden on mobile/tablet
+- Clickable navigation items with hover and active states
+- Left border design pattern consistent with site aesthetic
+
+### Usage
+```tsx
+import { TableOfContents } from "@/components/TableOfContents";
+
+const items = [
+  { id: "intro", label: "Introduction" },
+  { id: "philosophy", label: "Philosophy" },
+  { id: "contact", label: "Contact" }
+];
+
+<TableOfContents
+  items={items}
+  activeSection={activeSection}
+  onSectionClick={handleSectionClick}
+  className="optional-additional-classes"
+/>
+```
+
+### Props
+- `items`: Array of `TocItem` objects with `id` and `label`
+- `activeSection`: String ID of currently active section
+- `onSectionClick`: Callback function that receives section ID when clicked
+- `className`: Optional additional CSS classes
+
+### Dependencies
+- Requires `TableOfContentsProps` and `TocItem` types from `@/types`
+- Works with scroll spy functionality (see `useScrollSpy` hook)
+- Pairs well with `ContentSection` component for structured page layout
+
+### Styling Notes
+- Hidden on screens smaller than `lg` (1024px)
+- Fixed width of 256px (`w-64`)
+- Sticky positioned 32px from top (`top-8`)
+- Uses green-600 for active/hover states matching site theme
+- Left border with neutral-200 color and 16px padding

+        I believe what we call creativity is a resonance of
+        patterns already present in nature—from the elegant
+        machinery of proteins acting as molecular motors, to their
+        roles in signal transmission and threat detection. Our
+        innovations are echoes of solutions that biology perfected
+        eons ago. But that's the beauty. We're pattern matchers,
+        connection makers, bridge builders between what is and
+        what could be.

+        These days you'll find me thinking about reinforcement

-              I believe what we call creativity is a resonance of
-              patterns already present in nature—from the elegant

-              roles in signal transmission and threat detection. Our
-              innovations are echoes of solutions that biology perfected
-              eons ago. But that's the beauty. We're pattern matchers,
-              connection makers, bridge builders between what is and
-              what could be.

### FILE CONTENTS (SELECTED) ###

### frontend/.claude/task2.md ###
There is a professional history route that we setup in ProfessionalHistory.tsx. It is hooked up into the router and can be seen in the header links. 

For this page, I want to visualize a timeline, a compact timeline of my professional history. 

Dates are not as important as time ranges. Each section will have a start time and end time, ideally the end of one should be the srart of the next. 

In terms of a UI, we are still holding to our black and white minimalist style. But let your inspiration run, and build me something simple that still evokes the concept and feeling of a timeline, in the physics sense of that word. 

My resume content is at public/resume.md. Convert the points for each experience into a narrative. Brief points are good for resume, but when somebody is reading you want to make what you have written readable, brief and not overstaying the welcome of the attention it gets. 

Each experience, should be like an island in time, should connect to the next by a thread. The thread floppy, not awlasy straight but what ti does unfailingly, is to hold together time that you have lived through.

I want recruiters and VC to be able to get a broadstroke and then also read deeper if intrigued.

Localize your changes to the ProfessionalHistory page. Incorporate a table of component (it's prebuilt, see how to use it in ai-docs/available-to-use.md)-e

# Available Components for AI Use

## TableOfContents

**Location**: `src/components/TableOfContents.tsx`

### Description
A sticky table of contents component designed for long-form content pages. Provides navigation links for page sections with active section highlighting.

### How it's built
- React functional component with TypeScript
- Uses Tailwind CSS for styling with neutral color scheme and green accent
- Sticky positioned on large screens, hidden on mobile/tablet
- Clickable navigation items with hover and active states
- Left border design pattern consistent with site aesthetic

### Usage
```tsx
import { TableOfContents } from "@/components/TableOfContents";

const items = [
  { id: "intro", label: "Introduction" },
  { id: "philosophy", label: "Philosophy" },
  { id: "contact", label: "Contact" }
];

<TableOfContents
  items={items}
  activeSection={activeSection}
  onSectionClick={handleSectionClick}
  className="optional-additional-classes"
/>
```

### Props
- `items`: Array of `TocItem` objects with `id` and `label`
- `activeSection`: String ID of currently active section
- `onSectionClick`: Callback function that receives section ID when clicked
- `className`: Optional additional CSS classes

### Dependencies
- Requires `TableOfContentsProps` and `TocItem` types from `@/types`
- Works with scroll spy functionality (see `useScrollSpy` hook)
- Pairs well with `ContentSection` component for structured page layout

### Styling Notes
- Hidden on screens smaller than `lg` (1024px)
- Fixed width of 256px (`w-64`)
- Sticky positioned 32px from top (`top-8`)
- Uses green-600 for active/hover states matching site theme
- Left border with neutral-200 color and 16px padding-e

        I believe what we call creativity is a resonance of
        patterns already present in nature—from the elegant
        machinery of proteins acting as molecular motors, to their
        roles in signal transmission and threat detection. Our
        innovations are echoes of solutions that biology perfected
        eons ago. But that's the beauty. We're pattern matchers,
        connection makers, bridge builders between what is and
        what could be.

        These days you'll find me thinking about reinforcement
        learning, reading molecular biology papers, or building
        systems that help talented people find opportunities.
        Still the same person who learned that love is permanent,
        not passing. Still betting on myself.

        The turning point. Pandemic hit, was deep in educating

        Spent 9 months forcing my brain to connect every new idea
        to something I already knew, decomposing thoughts until I
        hit first principles. Uncomfortable as hell, but it
        worked. Eventually all knowledge felt
        interconnected—biology, physics, AI, spirituality,
        everything resonating across the same trunk of truth.

        I also interned at Apple, and started a company one after
        the other. Worked on high-profile projects such as App
        Store Redesign and Single Sign-On, but still, the fun I
        had at the startup had my heart. Came back, knew that I
        wanted to work as a PM at an early-stage startup. It was
        not an easy decision.
